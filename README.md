# Hi, I'm Ani! ˚౨ৎ

I'm a freshman Computer Engineering student at Purdue University with interests in hardware/software integration, machine learning, PC building, and embedded systems.

I have hands-on experience assembling PCs and enjoy learning how hardware and software interact at a low level.  
Currently, I’m exploring roles in **software engineering**, **computer hardware engineering**, and **early-career tech programs**.
